# Capital Expenditure Approval Process using SAP Business Technology Platform Workflow Management
## Overview
The CAPEX process enables customers to automate capital expenditure request approvals and provide automation across all steps. A request is created by the user and depending on the amount of investment and other related attributes, number of approval steps are determined.  The following steps are included as a part of this CAPEX process:
- Business user creates a Capital Expenditure Approval Process request
- Approvers are determined using decisions
- Approvers are notified via email
- Approvers have three decision options (Approve, Reject, Request Rework), and based on the decision, the next approval step will be created or requested for a rework or the approval request will be terminated.
- Acceptance from all Approvers will send a notification to the requestor and complete the process.
